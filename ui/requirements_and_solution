Problem:

There is no search functionality on the  rendered table containing malaria report of various patientfa-spin

Solution:

Add search functionality on the malaria report table to enable user to search for patients


Components involved 
- render-standard-report (app/shared/modules/standard-report/components/render-standard-report)

- iframe-based-standard-report (app/shared/modules/standard-report/components/iframe-based-standard-report)


render-standard-report is the main component that receives all the array of data to be rendered on the table.

This is found on the render-standard-report.component.ts

where the function evaluatedDataSetsReport receives response (array of list of patients) creates the table.

This table is then given as input to component iframe-based-standard-report


The component iframe-based-standard-report creates an iframe and then gives the innerHTML as the created table by the render-standard-report, Thus

iframe.innerHTML = table created by render-standard-report which was passed as input to iframe-based-standard-report



After understanding how the table is rendered the solution will be as followes:

1. To create a search input at the top of the table and the suitable component to create the input field is on the render-standard-report component.


2. Study the array of list of patients 

3. Create a function that filters based on the search term
